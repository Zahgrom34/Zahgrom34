# 👋 Hi, I'm Zahiriddin (aka Zahcoder34)

🚀 Developer of [Ascender Framework](https://github.com/ascender-team/ascenderframework) and [AgentHub AI Nexus] — building next-gen AI infra and making LLMs actually *do stuff*.

💡 I build tools for:
- ⚙️ AI automation (insurance, customer ops, telephony, legal assistance and etc)
- ⚡ High-performance inference infra
- 🧠 Memory-powered LLM agents
- 🕸️ Full-stack dev from backend to custom frontend frameworks

🧪 My playground includes:
- Python / Rust / TypeScript / C#
- FastAPI / Streamlit / SvelteKit
- Qwen, OpenAI, Whisper, LoRA, PPO, DPO
- ChromaDB / Kafka / Asterisk AMI / custom DI systems

⚡️ Currently working on:
- 🌐 AgentHub AI — smart agents for real-world tasks
- ⚗️ Ascender SpecTests — test architecture with DI baked in
- 🤖 AI voice + speech pipelines with WavTokenizer and Qwen Audio

🎯 Motto: “Don’t wait for tools to exist. Build them.”

> 🤖 Fun fact: I'm tuning LLMs to become personalities — not just tools, but something you can *actually* talk to. And maybe get roasted by... Just for fun, why not?
